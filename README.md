🩺 Breast Cancer Prediction

An AI-based Machine Learning project that predicts whether a breast tumor is benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) based on diagnostic features. This project demonstrates how artificial intelligence can assist in early detection of breast cancer, which is critical for timely treatment and improved survival rates.

📊 Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) for better understanding of features

🧠 Implements multiple machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.)

📈 Evaluates models with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC

🔍 Clean and reproducible workflow for medical data analysis

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python – Core programming language

Pandas, NumPy – Data processing & analysis

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization

Scikit-learn – Machine learning models & evaluation
